# fast6502

This project aims to provide a fast and accurate processor emulator of the 6502 which can be used to implement emulators of systems using the 6502 or otherwise run programs written for the 6502.

This project aims to be easy to use and minimal dependencies, ideally not even the standard library. It will also be provided under the same permissive dual license as the Rust project to make it easy to integrate into any project.

The hope is that one day this will be the best 6502 emulator library out there.
